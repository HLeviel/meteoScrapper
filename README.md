2. Create a cloud9 environment, and in the AWS Resources, create a new lambda application (for example application = meteo and Lamda = scrapper)
3. Get the code 
  * Navigate to your application folder
```cd meteo```
  * Add dependencies
```python3 -m pip install bs4 numpy pandas s3fs requests -t .```
  * Replace the file scrapper/lambda_function.py with the function from github
```wget -O scrapper/lambda_function.py "https://github.com/HLeviel/meteoscrapper/raw/master/meteoscrapper.py"```
4. Test the function in local 
5. Deploy the function in Lambda
